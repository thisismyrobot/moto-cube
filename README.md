# Shape-shifting cube

## Idea

Cubes that can locomote, or at least reconfigure a bit. I don't need them to
connect or disconnect, but it would be nice to get two hinges per cube at
least.

I'd like to use normal 90g servos or something as similarly commodity.

I'd also like the outside surface to be almost perfect when not in motion - no
protruding motors etc.

I really want the design to avoid this sort of protrusion at the hinge: ![](doc/bruton.png) ([source](https://youtu.be/opGOs7Zxeas?t=76))

## Current approach

Motorised cams that can push out of the side, each by 90Â°, against a matching
cam on the adjacent box.

No idea of the approach to doing the hinge, but I may use magnets to hold in
place at ends of motion.

## Model

`magicbox.scad` has all the parts themselves.

`configuration-*.scad` maps to the configurations shown in Inspiration, above.

## Algorithm for separation angle between boxes based on cam rotation

r = cam inner radius
c = cam outer radius
d = cam rotation from zero

### Wolfram Alpha

All angles need conversion to radians

    a = 2 * tan^(-1)((c * sin(90 - cos^(-1)(r/c) + d) - r) / (r + sqrt(c^2-(c * sin(90 - cos^(-1)(r/c) + d))^2)))

### OpenSCAD

Takes into account the whole turn:

```OpenSCAD
function separation_angle(d, r, c) =
    d < acos(r/c) ?
        -2 * atan((c * sin(90 - acos(r/c) + d) - r) / (r + sqrt(pow(c,2)- pow(c * sin(90 - acos(r/c) + d), 2))))
        :
        -2 * atan((c * sin(90 - acos(r/c) + d) - r) / (r - sqrt(pow(c,2)- pow(c * sin(90 - acos(r/c) + d), 2))));
```

### Python

```python
def box_angle_degrees(cam_angle_degrees, cam_inner_radius, cam_outer_radius):
    # Shorthand variables as per other implementations
    d = math.radians(cam_angle_degrees)
    r = float(cam_inner_radius)
    c = float(cam_outer_radius)

    if d < math.acos(r/c):
        return math.degrees(2 * math.atan((c * math.sin(math.radians(90) - math.acos(r/c) + d) - r) / (r + math.sqrt(pow(c, 2) - pow(c * math.sin(math.radians(90) - math.acos(r/c) + d), 2)))))
    else:
        return math.degrees(2 * math.atan((c * math.sin(math.radians(90) - math.acos(r/c) + d) - r) / (r - math.sqrt(pow(c, 2) - pow(c * math.sin(math.radians(90) - math.acos(r/c) + d), 2)))))
```
